- [ ] make arguments by name instead of positional, allowing missing arguments with default values

- [ ] make all available genes (in db) as genelist by default 

- [ ] in generate_sqlite_dbs.py add other_allele column

- [ ] use dosage allele rather than refAllele

- [ ] output message indicating the column name or number that is used as dosage or effect allele



- [ ] In predict_gene_expression.py add additional checks. Now it's not using the second allele information to set the sign of the weights.
